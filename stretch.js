3. Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. 
Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. 
This is a common interview question and great practice!

/*

    Functional programming is more concerned with the data itself, while object oriented programming is more about
    objects and classes. Functional is nice because it can be more effient, and shorter code. Because you don't have
    to define objects and classes you just keep all the important code. However, object oriented is also nice because
    it allows for good intereactions between the data you have, with all the structure that objects / classes give.
    Functional is good when you have a certain amount of data, and you want to add more and more operations on that data.
    On the other hand Object Oriented is good when you have a fixed amount of these operations, and want to add new
    data, because of the structure in place. Both are not mutually exclusive, as you can mix concepts and have functions
    objects and classes all coexisting if you want. But it's good to choose an overall design approach for your code.
